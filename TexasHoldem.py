        Example:
            game = TexasHoldem(['TUDOR', 'ANDREW'], 100, 2)
            Initializes a TexasHoldem game with two players, 100 chip count for each player
            and 2 chip big blind limit.

        Constants:
            RANKS(list): List containing card ranks of a typical standard 52-card deck of French playing cards.

            SUITS(list): List containing card suits of a typical standard 52-card deck of French playing cards.
            Suits are stored as str type. The suit values are as follows - 'spades', 'clubs', 'diamonds', 'hearts'
            RANK_NUM(dict): Dictionary containg the int value of each of the face cards - {'A' : 14, 'K': 13, 'Q': 12, 'J': 11}
            Card(namedtuple): Namedtuple constructor that is used to represent a card in the came e.g. card(rank='8', suit='clubs')
            represents one card of rank 8 and suit clubs.

        Args:
            players (list): List contatining player names as str type.
            buy_in (int): Value represeting the chip count of each player at the start of the game.

        Attributes:
            players(list): List contatining player names as str type.
            buy_in (int): Value represeting the fortune of each player at the start of the game.
            deck (list): Playing card deck as a list of namedtuples in the format card('rank', 'suit')

            class created by the Player class
            community_cards(list): List containing cards on Poker Table; initialized as empty list
            big_blind(int): Big-blind limit.
            small_blind(int): Small-blind limit; initialized as half the big-blind limit - e.g. if big-blind = 2
            then small-blind will be initialized with a value of 1.
            pot(int): Chip count of pot; initialized at 0
            hands_played(int): Counter to keep track of hands played; initialized at 0.
            small_blind_player(str): String containing the player name that is designated to place small-blind;
